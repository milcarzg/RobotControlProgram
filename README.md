ORIGINAL TASK

ROBOT CONTROL PROGRAM

You are tasked with creating the guidance program for a robot. The robot is very simple, it can walk around a room arranged as a grid of places. The input will be two numbers which tell the robot how big the room is.

  5 7

means 5 columns and 7 rows of places.

After the size of the room the robot guidance program should input two numbers and a letter, to indicate the starting position as a column and row number, and the compass orientation of the robot (North, South, East, West). Example:

  3 3 N

means that the robot should be in column 3 and row 3, and point to the north. 

Once positioned, the robot should be able to receive a number of navigation commands, in the form of letters. There are only three commands, L (turn left), R (turn right) and F (move 1 step forward).

Eï¿¼xample:  LFFRFRFRFF

After the last command is received, the robot should report its current location and direction.

Example:

5 5
1 2 N 
RFRFFRFRF 
Robot reports: 1 3 N

5 5
0 0 E
RFLFFLRF
Robot reports: 3 1 E

CHANGES

From the description one can read that first input should create a grid created of X columns and Y rows
input 5 7 - means 5 columns and 7 rows
Next input sets the origin of the robot
input 3 3 - means column 3 and row 3

Taking that into account second example could not be executed since there is no row 0 nad column 0
To unify the program couple of decisions was made:
- origin of the robot can not be smaller than 1 1

- description does say "After the size of the room the robot guidance program should input two numbers and a letter" that sentance is not clear:
    - should the program input random origin position?
- to unify the program user is asked to input origin position of the robot

- there was no description of how to handle user trying to walk into the wall of the room
    - robot acts like the move is not possible to make and counts "wall walk" attempts to display at the end

HOW TO

1. You can download the source code and import the program to eclipse. 
    - Pressing Run() will start the program in Eclipse console
    
2.  You can choose to download only the precompiled robot.jar file.
    - start Terminal
    - find the robot.jar file
    - execute 'java -jar robot.jar'
    - Program will start in Terminal and ask for input

EXAMPLES:

1.

  Enter size of the room :  (X Y format)

  5 5 

  Enter start point and orientation :  (X Y Z format)

  1 2 N

  Enter movements :  (XYZ format)

  RFRFFRFRF

  1 3 N

2.

  Enter size of the room :  (X Y format)  
  
  5 5 
  
  Enter start point and orientation :  (X Y Z format) 
 
  0 0 E 
 
  Origin position has to be between 1 1 and 5 5 
  
  Enter start point and orientation :  (X Y Z format) 
  
  1 1 E 
  
  Enter movements :  (XYZ format) 
  
  RFLFFLRF  
  
  4 2 E

TESTS

There are couple of tests created to verify that core methods are working correctly
Test passed 9/9

To run tests import project into Eclipse and run Tests.java class as jUnit Test.
