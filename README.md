# RobotControlProgram
simple project for interview purposes


Couple of changes
- origin point can`t be smaller than 1 1
  - change due to inconsistency in program description : 3 3 N is supposed to be column 3 and row 3
    
  - so example point : 0 0 E does not exist
    
- added extra message when user entered move combination that results in walking into wall

- step 2 of the program (robot initial position) - changed to be user input - that`s more logical than random possition generated by program.

- didn`t use any testing libraries, I only used System.out.println() for verifying
