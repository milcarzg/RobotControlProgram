# RobotControlProgram
simple project for interview purposes


Couple of changes
- origin point can`t be smaller than 1 1
  - change due to inconsistency in program description : 3 3 N is supposed to be column 3 and row 3
    
  - so example point : 0 0 E does not exist
    
  -added extra message when user entered move combination that results in walking into wall
